**Features**
1) Generates conflict-free timetables
2) Assigns subjects to teachers, rooms, and labs automatically
3) Handles multiple programs, sessions, and days
4) Uses Genetic Algorithm for optimization instead of brute-force search

**Tech Stack**
1) Backend: .NET, C#
2) Database: MS SQL
3) Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm
